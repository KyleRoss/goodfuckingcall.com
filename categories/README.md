# Categories
You made it to the categories! This tidbit of documentation is to outline the categories in which all the phrases/sarcasms are defined. **NOTE:** Read the rules in the repo README about adding categories and phrases.

## Category Definitions
**NEW:** By default, we concatenate all of the phrases into one file on build and now people will see one random one from the whole shebang.

### misc (@kyleross)
TIt can contain any generic sarcasms that just don't fit anywhere else or that you cannot come up with enough phrases to start a category for it. They MUST be relavant to most people, so don't add one in which at least 70% of people wouldn't get.

### programming (@kyleross)
I'm a programmer and chances you are too, so add your favorite sarcasms that have to do with programming. There are plenty of them out there!

### job (@kyleross)
Work/job related phrases. Something you've seen in the office or wanted to do to your boss.

### restroom (@kyleross)
Restroom related phrases (aka potty jokes).

### shitfield (@kyleross)
This is my **one** exception to the "don't create a category about a person that is not significant" and "no inside jokes". This one contains some of the best "isms" from a good friend of ours and just had to be somewhere. Don't submit new ones to this category unless you know him.
