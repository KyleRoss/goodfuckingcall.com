# Categories
You made it to the categories! This tidbit of documentation is to outline the categories in which all the phrases/sarcasms are defined. **NOTE:** Read the rules in the repo README about adding categories and phrases.

## Category Definitions

### default (@kyleross)
This is the default category, the one everyone sees after they are tricked into coming to this stupid site. It can contain any generic sarcasms that just don't fit anywhere else or that you cannot come up with enough phrases to start a category for it. They MUST be relavant to most people, so don't add one in which at least 70% of people would get.

### programming (@kyleross)
I'm a programmer and chances you are too, so add your favorite sarcasms that have to do with programming. There are plenty of them out there!

### shitfield (@kyleross)
This is my **one** exception to the "don't create a category about a person that is not significant" and "no inside jokes". This one contains some of the best "isms" from a good friend of ours and just had to be somewhere. Don't submit new ones to this category unless you know him.
